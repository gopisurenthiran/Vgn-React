        The documentation required to be submitted by the NRIs are different
        from the Resident Indians as they are required to submit additional
        documents, like copy of the passport and a copy of the works contract,
        etc. and of course NRIs have to follow certain eligibility criteria in
        order to get Home Loans in India. Another vital document required while
        processing an NRI home loan is the power of attorney (POA). The POA is
        important because, since the borrower is not based in India; the Home
        Finance Company would need a 'representative' 'in lieu of' the NRI to
        deal with and if needed. Although not obligatory, the POA is usually
        drawn on the NRI's parents/wife/children/ close relatives or friends.
        <br />
        The documents needed for obtaining NRI home loans are Bank specific.
        General list of documents are as mentioned below:

    question:
      "What is the Tax treatment for income generated from property selling or renting for NRI/PIO/OCI?",
    answer: `The mere acquisition of property does not attract income tax. However, any income accruing from the ownership of it, in the form of rent (if it is let out)/annual value of the house (if is not let out and it is not the only residential property owned by that person in India) and/or capital gains (short term or long term) arising on the sale of this house or part thereof is taxable in the hands of the owner.`,

  },
  {
    question:
      "How does Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement work in case of NRIs?",
    answer: `In case of sale of an immovable property, the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with most countries state that capital gains will be taxed in the country where the immovable property is situated. Hence, if an NRI owns immovable property in India, then he/she will be subject to pay tax in India on the capital gains which arise on the sale of the property. Similarly, letting of immovable property in India would be taxed in India under most tax treaties.`,
